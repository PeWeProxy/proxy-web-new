        <strong>You don't need to worry about your privacy.</strong> We need to know a little
        bit about you in order to improve and personalize your Web experience, so we log part
        of your activity on the Web â€” the Web page address and time of your visit. This information
        is linked with your randomly generated identifier. <strong>Your data is completely
        anonymous</strong>, we cannot link your random identifier back to you (at least not without
        your help)

	Proxy logs just the visited URL address, <strong>we don't store the actual Web site content or the
        messages your browser is sending</strong> (like the content of the forms). If you setup the proxy
        using our guide, then it will <strong>never be used</strong> to access secure (https) websites,
        like login forms or Internet Banking - your browser will always connect directly to these pages.
        If you are browsing through Firefox, you can setup your own customized list of pages where proxy
        will never be used.
